"""
Excel export utilities.

This module provides a single entry point ``export_rows_to_excel``
that accepts an iterable of dictionaries (ledger rows) and produces
an in-memory Excel workbook containing the data. Returning the
workbook as a ``BytesIO`` object allows callers such as a
Streamlit application to embed the file directly in a download
button without having to manage temporary files on disk. Should a
file path be provided, the function will also write the file to
disk to support batch or command-line usage. The columns of the
Excel file are taken from the keys of the first row in the input
sequence to ensure a consistent ordering.

    """Create an Excel workbook from an iterable of ledger rows.

    Given a list (or other iterable) of dictionaries representing
    accounting journal entries, this function constructs a pandas
    ``DataFrame`` with a stable column order and writes it into an
    Excel file. By default, the file is written into an in-memory
    ``BytesIO`` object and returned to the caller. If ``output_path``
    is provided, the workbook will also be persisted to that location
    on disk. Callers such as Streamlit can pass the resulting
    ``BytesIO`` directly to a download button.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rows : iterable of mapping
        Each element should be a mapping (e.g. dict) keyed by column
        names. All rows should contain the same set of keys.

    output_path : str or Path or None, optional
        If supplied, the generated workbook will additionally be written
        to this location. Parent directories will be created as
        necessary. If omitted or ``None``, the workbook is only
        returned in-memory.

    sheet_name : str, optional
        Name of the worksheet. Defaults to "Sheet1".

    index : bool, optional
        Whether to include the DataFrame index in the output file.

    Returns
    -------
    io.BytesIO
        A bytes buffer containing the Excel file content.
