Lowâ€‘level utilities for working with PDF files.

This module wraps pymupdf (also known as fitz) to provide a simple
interface for extracting text from PDF documents. If a document
contains a text layer, the extracted string will include all visible
text. If the document is purely scanned images and no text is
embedded, the returned string may be empty. In such cases the caller
may opt to perform OCR using an external library such as Tesseract,
but that is outside the scope of this helper.
